### Prototype

The TraDE4Chor prototype consists of three major building blocks:

- the [Transparent Data Exchange (TraDE) Middleware](https://github.com/traDE4chor/trade-core),
- a [Web UI](https://github.com/traDE4chor/trade-web-ui) to interact with the TraDE Middleware, and
- a [Data Transformation (DT) Integration Middleware](https://github.com/traDE4chor/hdtapps-prototype).
